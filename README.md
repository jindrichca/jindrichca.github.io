This will serve as my personal website where I can write articles about things that I have learned or am interested in.

It will mainly serve my interests as a creative outlet where I can keep track of what I have learned and as a place to relearn things.

The content of the site will mostly be on electrical engineering and computer science topics, along with whatever interests me enough to write about
